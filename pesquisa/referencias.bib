abstract = {The rectangle packing problem often appears in encasement and cutting as well as very large-scale integration design. To solve this problem, many algorithms such as genetic algorithm, simulated annealing and other heuristic algorithms have been proposed. In this paper, a new heuristic algorithm is recommended based on two important concepts, namely, the corner-occupying action and caving degree. Twenty-one rectangle-packing instances are tested by the algorithm developed, 16 of which having achieved optimum solutions within reasonable runtime. Experimental results demonstrate that the algorithm developed is fairly efficient for solving the rectangle packing problem.}

abstract = {Cutting and packing problems are encountered in many industries, with different industries incorporating different constraints and objectives. The wood-, glass- and paper industry are mainly concerned with the cutting of regular figures, whereas in the ship building, textile and leather industry irregular, arbitrary shaped items are to be packed. In this paper two genetic algorithms are described for a rectangular packing problem. Both GAs are hybridised with a heuristic placement algorithm, one of which is the well-known Bottom-Left routine. A second placement method has been developed which overcomes some of the disadvantages of the Bottom-Left rule. The two hybrid genetic algorithms are compared with heuristic placement algorithms. In order to show the effectiveness of the design of the two genetic algorithms, their performance is compared to random search.}

    abstract = {A new method of packing the rectangles (modules) is presented with applications to IC layout design. It is based on the bounded-sliceline grid (BSG) structure. The BSG dissects the plane into rooms associated with binary relations ``right-to''and ``above'' such that any two rooms are uniquely in either relation. A packing is obtained through an assignment of modules on the BSG, followed by physical realization BSG-PACK. A simulated annealing searches for a good packing of all packings by changing the assignments. Experiments showed that hundreds of rectangles are easily packed in a small rectangle area (chip) with a quite good quality in area efficiency. A wide adaptability is demonstrated specific to IC layout design. Remarkable examples are: the chip is not necessarily rectangle, L-shaped modules and modules which are allowed to partially overlap each other can be handled.},
